ComicCrafter AI 

ComicCrafter AI is a generative AI-powered comic creator that runs locally on edge devices. It generates comic-style stories based on user-provided prompts. This project blends AI-generated storytelling with visually engaging comic panels, providing a fun and interactive experience.  

Features:

✅ AI-Powered Storytelling – Generates multi-panel comics from text prompts  
✅ Stylized Comic Panels – Aesthetically designed UI with a vibrant comic-book theme  
✅ Fast & Local Execution – Runs on edge devices without relying on cloud services  
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple input box for prompts and easy comic generation  

Using OpenAI's GPT-4 for script generation and DALL·E for image creation, comicgenerator.py (Python script) automates the production of AI-generated comics.  A user-provided concept serves as the basis for creating a structured comic script that is formatted into labelled panels with dialogue and explanations.  To ensure a well-structured format, the script is then analyzed using regular expressions to retrieve individual panels.  The story is graphically brought to life by feeding the description of each panel into DALL·E, which creates accompanying drawings.
